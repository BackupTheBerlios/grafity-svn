Introduction
------------

The worksheet is a type of window available in the Origin project. Its primary function is to hold and organize
the data that you bring into Origin, although data manipulation, exploration, and analysis are often and easily
performed within the worksheet. 

When Origin starts, it opens a new project displaying a single worksheet created from the ORIGIN.OTW worksheet
template. Like other window types, you can open multiple worksheets in an Origin project. To open additional
worksheets in the project, select File:New. This menu command opens the New dialog box. Select Worksheet from
the Window Type list box. Select the desired template from the Template drop-down list and then click OK to
close the dialog box and open the new worksheet. 

Performing Basic Worksheet Operations
-------------------------------------

To help you organize your worksheet data, Origin provides menu commands and tools to add, delete, and arrange
columns, and to insert and delete rows. Additionally, you can transpose the columns and rows in your worksheet. 

Adding Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To add columns to the worksheet, perform one of the following operations: 
1) Select Column:Add New Columns. 
2) Click the Add New Columns button on the Standard toolbar. 
3) Right-click inside the worksheet window but to the right of the worksheet grid. Select Add New Column from
the shortcut menu. 
The Column:Add New Columns menu command opens the Add New Columns dialog box in which you specify the number of
columns to add to the worksheet. The Add New Columns button on the Standard toolbar and the Add New Column
shortcut menu command add one column to the worksheet. Each method adds the Y column(s) to the right of the
last worksheet column. Each new column is named alphabetically (A, B, C, ... X, Y, Z, AA, BB, CC, ...),
starting with the first letter that is not already used as a column name in the worksheet. 

Inserting Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To add a single column to a specific location in the worksheet, highlight the column located to the immediate right
of where you want to insert the column and select Edit:Insert or right-click and select Insert from the shortcut
menu. The new column inserts to the immediate left of the highlighted column. The new column is designated as a Y
column, independent of the designation of the highlighted column. Each new column is named alphabetically, starting
with the first letter that is not already used as a column name in the worksheet. 
To insert n columns in a specific location in the worksheet, perform the single insertion method n times.
Alternatively, highlight n columns to the immediate right of where you want to insert the new columns and then
select Edit:Insert or right-click and select Insert from the shortcut menu. 

Deleting Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To delete one or more columns from the worksheet, highlight the column(s) and select Edit:Delete or right-click and
select Delete. Note that when you delete columns (data sets) from the worksheet, any other visual representation of
the data sets will also be deleted from the project. For example, if you delete a column of data that also displays
as a data plot in a graph window, the data plot is deleted from the graph window. 
Note: To clear the column values but retain the columns, select Edit:Clear. 

Moving Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To move the highlighted column to the first (leftmost) position in the worksheet, select Column:Move to First. To
move the highlighted column to the last (rightmost) position in the worksheet, select Column:Move to Last. If more
than one column is selected, the selected columns move, maintaining their existing order. 
You can also move columns using the following buttons on the Column toolbar: Move to First, Move to Last, Move Left,
Move Right 
To open the Column toolbar, select View:Toolbars and select the Column check box. To use these buttons, highlight
the desired column(s) and click the appropriate button. 

Inserting Rows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To insert a single row in a specific location in the worksheet, highlight the row that is directly below where you
want to insert the new row and then select Edit:Insert or right-click and select Insert from the shortcut menu. The
new row inserts above the highlighted row. 
To insert n rows in a specific location in the worksheet, perform the single insertion method n times.
Alternatively, highlight n rows directly below where you want to insert the new rows and then select Edit:Insert or
right-click and select Insert from the shortcut menu. 

Deleting Rows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To delete one or more rows from the worksheet, highlight the row(s) and select Edit:Delete or right-click and select
Delete. After deleting the selected rows, the rows below the selection move up in the worksheet. 
Note: To clear the cell contents but retain the row(s), select Edit:Clear instead of Edit:Delete. 

Transposing the Columns and Rows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To transpose the columns and rows in the active worksheet, select Edit:Transpose. This menu command exchanges the
worksheet columns with rows, and the rows with columns. 
1) Prior to transposing, if the worksheet contains more row values than columns, Origin adds the necessary columns
to the worksheet during the transpose process. Origin names these added columns alphabetically, starting with the
first letter that is not already used as a column name in the worksheet. 
2) Prior to transposing, if the worksheet contains more columns than row values, Origin maintains the extra columns
in the worksheet. This default behavior can be altered by selecting a new option from the Delete Empty Columns After
Worksheet Transpose drop-down list on the Miscellaneous tab of the Options dialog box (Tools:Options). 
Note: To transpose the columns and rows in your worksheet, each of the columns in the worksheet must be of the same
"display type." For example, each of the columns must be set to "Text and Numeric" type, or "Numeric" type. The
column display type is set from the Display drop-down list in each column's Worksheet Column Format dialog box.
Double-click on a column heading to open this dialog box. In the default Origin worksheet, each column is set to the
"Text and Numeric" display type. 

Entering and Deleting Data in the Worksheet
-------------------------------------------
Origin provides several ways to add data to the worksheet: 
1) Entering data using the keyboard. 
2) Importing a file. 
3) Pasting data from another application using the Clipboard. 
4) Pasting data from another (or the same) Origin worksheet using the Clipboard. 
5) Creating a data set based on row numbers or random numbers. 
6) Using a function to set column values. 
7) Setting incremental X values. 
Note: If you are displaying numbers in a worksheet cell using a format that does not show the entire number, Origin
will now display the cell value as ######. This differs from previous versions of Origin, in which the numbers
incompletely displayed, sometimes causing confusion over the actual cell value. 
Even though the cell value will now display as ######, when you enter the cell editing mode, the numbers display. 
This feature is controlled by a LabTalk numeric system variable. To disable this feature, type the following line in
the Script window: 
@wc = 1 (PRESS ENTER) 
To reactivate the feature, set @wc back to 0. 


Filling Columns with Row Numbers or Random Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To quickly fill a column, or a selected range of cells, with either the associated row number, uniform random
numbers, or normal random numbers, perform one of the following operations after selecting the desired cells: 
1) To fill with row numbers, click the Set Column Value According to Row Number button on the Worksheet Data
toolbar. Alternatively, select Column:Fill Column With:Row Numbers or right-click and select Fill Column With:Row
Numbers. 
2) To fill with uniform random numbers, click the Set Column Values with Uniform Random Numbers button on the
Worksheet Data toolbar. Alternatively, select Column:Fill Column With:Uniform Random Numbers or right-click and
select Fill Column With:Uniform Random Numbers. 
3) To fill with normal random numbers, click the Set Column Values with Normal Random Numbers button on the
Worksheet Data toolbar. Alternatively, select Column:Fill Column With:Normal Random Numbers or right-click and
select Fill Column With:Normal Random Numbers. 
For the normal random number fill, the mean and the standard deviation are controlled by the NORMAL_MEAN and
NORMAL_SIGMA variables in the [FillColumn] section of the ORIGIN.INI file. By default, these variables are set to 0
and 1, respectively. For the uniform random number fill, the minimum and maximum numbers generated are determined by
the UNIFORM_MIN and UNIFORM_MAX variables. By default, these variables are set to 0 and 1, respectively.

Using Functions to Set Column Values or Mathematically Transform Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To create or transform data sets using any mathematical expression recognized by Origin, perform one of the
following operations after selecting a worksheet column or a range of cells in a column: 
1) Select Column:Set Column Values. 
2) Right-click and select Set Column Values from the shortcut menu. 
3) Click the Set Column Values button on the Worksheet Data toolbar. 
The Set Column Values Dialog Box 
1) Select a Worksheet Range 
After you select a column or a range of cells in a column and then open this dialog box, the beginning and ending
row numbers in your worksheet column selection are automatically displayed in the For Row (i) and To text boxes. To
alter the selection range, type new values in these text boxes. After editing this dialog box and clicking OK,
calculated values are entered only in the cells that fall within the selection range. 
2) Select the Function(s) and Data set(s) 
The Add Function and Add Column drop-down lists and associated buttons are provided to help you build the desired
expression in the ColumnName= text box. Instead of typing the proper function and data set syntax directly in the
ColumnName= text box, you can select functions and data sets from these drop-down lists. 
The Add Function drop-down list includes Origin's built-in mathematical and statistical distribution functions. To
view the details of a function, select the function from the drop-down list. A function summary including a
description of the function arguments displays in the left view box. To select a function so that it displays in the
ColumnName= text box, click the Add Function button after selecting it from the drop-down list. How the function
displays in the ColumnName= text box depends on whether any text was highlighted in the text box prior to selecting
the function. If text was highlighted in the text box, then that text becomes the (last) argument for the selected
function. If no text was highlighted, then the function displays at the last active cursor location in the text box. 
The Add Column drop-down list includes an entry for each of the columns in the active worksheet. Select a column
from the drop-down list and then click the Add Column button. If text was highlighted in the ColumnName= text box,
Origin overtypes this text with the selected column name. Otherwise, Origin adds the column name at the last active
cursor location in the text box. 
3) Complete the Expression in the ColumnName= Text Box 
The expression you type in this text box is used to fill the selected worksheet column cells with values. The
expression can include any data sets (columns) in the project as well as any of Origin's built-in functions. The Add
Function and Add Column controls provide an easy method for adding mathematical and statistical distribution
functions and data sets from the same worksheet to the expression. However, you can use any of Origin's built-in
functions, following the syntax described in the LabTalk Manual. You can also access data sets from other worksheets
using the WorksheetName_ColumnName syntax. For example, to specify the C column in the Data3 worksheet, you can type
Data3_C. In addition to data sets and functions, you can use any operators recognized by Origin, as well as any
defined variables. 
The variable i can be used in an expression to indicate the row number. For example, the expression col(A)=i fills
column A with row number values. 
Note: Do not include a semicolon after the expression entered in the Set Column Values dialog box. 
4) The OK Button 
Click this button to close the dialog box and set the values for the selected cells according to the specified
expression in the ColumnName= text box. 
5) The Undo/Redo Button 
Click this button to undo/redo the last change made to the expression in the ColumnName= text box. 
Note: To update all the columns in the active worksheet in which you have set a formula using Set Column Values,
select Analysis:Set All Column Values or click the Set All Column Values button on the Worksheet Data toolbar. This
is an easy method for updating, as opposed to opening each column's Set Column Values dialog box and clicking OK. 

Deleting Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To clear the entire contents of a worksheet, select Edit:Clear Worksheet. An Attention box opens confirming your
menu selection. 
To delete a range of cells from the worksheet, select the desired cells and select Edit:Delete. The Edit:Delete menu
command can also be used to delete a selected column or row from the worksheet. When the Edit:Delete menu command is
selected, the worksheet values, as well as the worksheet cells, are deleted. 
Data can be deleted from the worksheet without deleting the corresponding cells. To accomplish this, select the
cells containing the data you want to delete and press the DELETE key. Missing values (--) fill the selected cells.
Alternatively, select Edit:Clear to delete the values from the selected cells. 

Selecting Worksheet Data
------------------------
Many of Origin's plotting and analysis features act on the data that is currently selected in the active worksheet.
The worksheet's data selection methods are reviewed in the following sections. 

Selecting the Entire Worksheet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To select all the columns in the worksheet, perform one of the following operations: 
1) Point to the blank space in the upper-left corner of the worksheet, so that the mouse pointer changes to an
arrow, and click the left mouse button. 
2) Click to select the first column heading and then drag to the last column in the worksheet. Release the mouse
button to select all the columns. (Note: Origin does not automatically scroll the columns.) 
3) Click to select the first column heading, scroll the worksheet to display the last column, and then hold down the
SHIFT key and click on the last column heading. 

Selecting Adjacent Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To select adjacent columns in the worksheet, perform one of the following operations: 
1) Click to select the first column heading in the desired range and then drag to the last column in the desired
range. Release the mouse button to select the columns. (Note: Origin does not automatically scroll the columns.) 
2) Click to select the first column heading in the desired range, scroll the worksheet to display the last column in
the desired range, and then hold down the SHIFT key and click on this last column heading. 

Selecting Rows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To select a row range, perform one of the following operations: 
1) Click to select the first row heading in the desired range and then drag to the last row in the desired range.
Release the mouse button to select the rows. 
2) Click to select the first row heading in the desired range, scroll the worksheet to display the last row in the
desired range, and then hold down the SHIFT key and click on this last row heading. 

Selecting Cells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To select a range of cells in the worksheet, click-and-drag to select the cells. 

Deleting a Worksheet from a Project
-----------------------------------
When you delete a worksheet, you delete the worksheet window from the project, as well as all the data contained in
the worksheet. Any other visual representations of that data are also deleted from the project. Thus, any data plots
based on the deleted worksheet data are deleted from the respective graph windows. 
To delete a worksheet from the project, perform one of the following operations: 
1) Click the Close Window button in the upper-right corner of the worksheet. 
2) Right-click on the worksheet window icon in Project Explorer and select Delete Window from the shortcut menu. 
3) Click on the worksheet window icon in Project Explorer and then press DELETE. 
Because of the potential for unexpected loss of data, Origin opens a Deletion Confirmation box. 
Note: Hiding a worksheet instead of deleting it allows you to visually remove the worksheet from the workspace, but
maintain the window and data in the project. If you hide the worksheet, you can re-activate its view in the Project
Explorer.


When evaluating calculated columns, the namespace used contains the following (in order of precedence):

* math, using ``from grafity.arrays import *`` (which includes numarray)

* ``here``, ``top``, ``up`` and ``this`` with their usual meanings

* all column names of the current worksheet

* all objects in the current folder
