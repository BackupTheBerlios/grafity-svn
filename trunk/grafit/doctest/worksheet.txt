The ``grafit.worksheet`` module
================================

Calculated columns
------------------

When evaluating calculated columns, the namespace used contains the following (in order of precedence):

* math, using ``from grafit.arrays import *`` (which includes numarray)

* ``here``, ``top``, ``up`` and ``this`` with their usual meanings

* all column names of the current worksheet

* all objects in the current folder
