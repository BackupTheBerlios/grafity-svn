The following special names are defined:

* `here`: the current folder

* `up`: the parent of the current folder

* `top`: the top-level folder

* `this`: the current object (shown in the main window)

These names are updated in ``project._dict``.

Also in ``project._dict`` are the contents (subfolders and items)
of the current folder.  Programatically, you can get these object 
with ``project.top.contents()``.
